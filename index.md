  <p class="intro-text reveal">My name is Jorge Esteban Ramírez Sashida and I was born on June 27, 2002. I'm currently studying Data Science at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). My favorite things in life are music, the sea, chess, sports, my family, and my pets.</p>

      <span>Data Science</span>
    </h3>
    <p>I love studying and learning about data science and mathematics. I really enjoy programming, especially using machine learning. My work has spanned from building ETL pipelines to developing AI models for music classification and implementing minimax algorithms for game AI. Check out my <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> and <a href="/career/">career timeline</a> to learn more about my journey!</p>

      <span class="jp-accent">音楽</span>
      <span>Music</span>
    </h3>
    <p>Music is my passion, both listening and playing. I've played the piano since I was 4 years old, and over the years I've learned guitar, keyboard, drums, bass guitar, and ukulele. My favorite genres are jazz and rock. One of my big dreams is to use my knowledge in data science to have an impact on the music industry—perhaps by creating better recommendation algorithms or finding ways to generate more revenue for artists.</p>

        <span>The Sea</span>
      </h3>
      <p>Ever since I can remember, I've spent most of my holidays near the sea. I'm passionate about freediving and I'm also a certified scuba diver. I believe I have a special connection with the sea and the animals that live in it. One of my favorite animals is the hawksbill turtle, and I've been fortunate to have many encounters with them while diving.</p>
