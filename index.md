My name is Jorge Esteban Ramírez Sashida and I was born in June 27, 2002. I am currently studying data science at Tecnológico Mexicano Autónomo de México. My favourite things in life are music, the ocean,chess, sports, my family and my pets. In this blog I will share music, movies, programming projects and anything that I may find interesting.
