<div class="main-content">
  <p class="intro-text reveal">My name is Jorge Esteban Ramírez Sashida and I was born on June 27, 2002. I recently graduated with a degree in Data Science from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). My favorite things in life are music, the sea, chess, sports, my family, and my pets.</p>

  <p class="passions-intro reveal">Here you can find some of the things that I like:</p>

  <div class="passion-block reveal">
    <h3 class="passion-title">
      <span class="jp-accent">データサイエンス</span>
      <span>Data Science</span>
    </h3>
    <p>I've started to genuinely enjoy software development projects centered on data science. Building data-driven tools, like MCP servers, ETL pipelines, and machine learning APIs, has become one of my favorite ways to bring together my interests in programming and mathematics. You can see more about my journey in my <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> and <a href="/career/">career timeline</a>!</p>

    <h3 class="passion-title">
      <span class="jp-accent">音楽</span>
      <span>Music</span>
    </h3>
    <p>Music is my passion, both listening and playing. I've played the piano since I was 4 years old, and over the years I've learned guitar, keyboard, drums, bass guitar, and ukulele. My favorite genres are jazz and rock. One of my big dreams is to use my knowledge in data science to have an impact on the music industry—perhaps by creating better recommendation algorithms or finding ways to generate more revenue for artists.</p>

        <span class="jp-accent">海</span>
        <span>The Sea</span>
      </h3>
      <p>Ever since I can remember, I've spent most of my holidays near the sea. I'm passionate about freediving and I'm also a certified scuba diver. I believe I have a special connection with the sea and the animals that live in it. One of my favorite animals is the hawksbill turtle, and I've been fortunate to have many encounters with them while diving.</p>
