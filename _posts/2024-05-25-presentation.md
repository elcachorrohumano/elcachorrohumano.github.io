## The name

I named my page Chaos Space Marine after one of my favourite songs by Black Country New Road. I am going to take advantage of this introduction to share the lyrics of the song with you:

And though England is mine

I must leave it all behind

The war is over

Lift the anchor, set an open course

The New York state lines

I think of all that went wrong

The sailor boys line up in song

And they sing of London

Love thy neighbor

Will it really last

Anytime

What's that, that you said to me

Oh, I'm a chaos space marine

So what, I love you

Darling, will you take my metal hand

It's cold

In time you will find

These things take up space inside your mind

Where you could be keeping honest thoughts of the sea, alone

So I'm leaving this body

And I'm never coming home again, yeah

I'll bury the hatchet

Between the window, and the kingdom of men

Oh, I'm becoming a worm now

And, I'm looking for a place to live, yeah

Here I come now

In time you will find

These things take up

In time you will find

These things take up

In time you will find

These things take you

And now, so long jobs

I'm coming home

(Oh yeah)

Billie Eilish style

A Concorde will fly

Ignore the whole I've dug again

Oh yeah

Songwriters: Charlie Wayne / Georgia Ellery / Isaac Wood / Lewis Evans / Luke Mark / May Kershaw / Sergio Maschetzko / Tyler Hyde

This song is introductory to one of my all time favourite albums called Ants From Up There (it is actually the second song on the album but it is the first one with any lyrics). I will talk about this album later in the blog. For now, I hope you go listen the song and like it very much :).
