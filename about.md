My name is Jorge Esteban Ramírez Sashida and I was born in June 27, 2002. I am currently studying data science at Tecnológico Mexicano Autónomo de México. My favourite things in life are music, the ocean, chess, sports, my family and my pets. In this blog I will share music, movies, programming projects and anything that I may find interesting.

## About me

I think of no better way to tell you about myself than to tell you the things I like to do.

The main thing is music, both listening and playing. I have played the piano since I was 4 years old and now I know other instruments too. I can play guitar, keyboard, drums, bass guitar and ukulele. My favourite genres are jazz and rock.

Ever since I can remember, most of my hollidays I spend near the sea. I like to freedive and I am also a certified scuba diver. I like to beleive that I have a special connection with the ocean and with the animals that live in it. One of my favourite animals is the hawksbill turtle and I have the fortune of having a lot of encounters with them while diving.

I also like to study and learn about data science and mathematics. I really enjoy programming, specially in using machine learning. One of my big dreams is to use my knowlegde to have an impact on the music industry. I can achieve this maybe by creating better recommendation algorythms, maybe finding a way to generate more revenues for the artists.

I will be updating the blog, hope you enjoy :)
